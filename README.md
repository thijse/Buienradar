BuienRadar API - Retreiving rain prediction and weather information for the Netherlands
====================

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20License-blue.svg)](http://doge.mit-license.org)

*A .NET API for fetching rain predictions and weather information from BuienRadar, including demonstration application.*

BuienRadar API is an API that fetches raw rain precipitation through the free Buienradar API at "http://gadgets.buienradar.nl/data/raintext?lat=LATTITUDE&lon=LONGITUDE" and weatherstation information at "https://xml.buienradar.nl/". The data is cached for a settable duration in order to not overburden the buienradar servers. It also provides a rain info-to-text translation finding perionds of rain and describing these.

To demonstrate the usage of the API, a minimal application has been included that fetches the data, based on any given location (using the Google location service)
